	* EagleCAD schematics and board layout files
	* Bill of Materials
	* Flight code for the onboard MSP430 microcontroller

- Ground Station
	* A GNU Radio based software radio receiver for the Sprite
	* A link budget spreadsheet for the Sprite spacecraft
	
- Sprite Deployer (A deployer that fits in a Pumpkin CubeSat structure)
	* CAD design files for the Sprite deployer
	* ICD specifying mechanical and electrical interfaces
	* Driver code for the Pumpkin flight computer
	* Bill of materials

- Development Kit
	* A customized Ubuntu-based linux liveCD
	* MSP-GCC toolchain configured for the Sprite
	* GNU Radio configured to receive Sprite signals 
	* Code examples
